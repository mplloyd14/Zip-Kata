Project-Evolution Locale Demo
======================

This simple demonstration presents multi-locale translations, both on the server and the client, and data formatting on the client.

# Getting started

Clone the repo and checkout the locale_demo branch or retrieve the zip of the locale_demo branch from github.

## Install Dependencies
From a git shell, change to the demo working folder and execute the command:

`npm install`

## Load seed data
WARNING! This will destroy any existing seed data for MOBILEconnect that you may have!

##### Windows
`scripts\import.bat`

##### *nix
`./scripts/import.sh`

## Start the project
From a command shell, execute the following command:

`npm start`

## Browse to the page

From either a desktop or mobile browser

`http://localhost:5000/product/localedemo`

(Substitute the DNS name or IP address for localhost when browing from a mobile device)

### To view different locales/languages
Change the browser locale. This is highly dependent on the browser and the platform.

Desktop chrome and firefox are fairly painless, and simple instructions are easily found in the interweb.

Mobile devices generally require that the device settings be modified, so be sure to note the layout of settings in case you don't speak another language!
