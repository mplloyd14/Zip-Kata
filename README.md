Unless you have a good reason to use this branch, [go here instead](https://github.com/CommandAlkon/pe-seed/tree/master).

Almost all of [this README](https://github.com/CommandAlkon/pe-seed/blob/master/README.md) will be relevant here. Follow the same general directions, then come back here and reado on...

If you're feeling saucy, you can run the app as usual (`npm start`), and in another terminal (or powershell?) run `gulp`. This will start a Browser Sync server that will inject your changes into the page.
